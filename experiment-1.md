# Experiment - Rescue of RscS deficient ES114 by essential MB11B1 genes
## Question - which gene(s) in MB11B1 would cause RscS deficient ES114 to re-colonize?
*Note: in transposon mutant community, 'mutant depletions' are representative of a unique gene that was disrupted by the randomly inserted transposon (via mariner). Therefore as evidenced by its depletion, it was necessary or 'essential' for colonzation.*

1. Need to optimize conditions for MB11B1-transposon uptake

2. Generate transposon mutant library of MB11B1.

3. Pick the mutants which do not colonize 

4. Use INSeq to identify colonization factor candidates; 'essential' genes, form **bank**

5. Grow up community of RscS deficient ES114.
    ~**gene deletion** protocol on GitHub

6. Place genes from 'bank' into plasmid vectors
  ~**Gibson assembly?**

7. Using **conjugation,** mix (replication deficient) vectors with RscS deficient ES114 for uptake

*this yields MB11B1 genes into the RscSdef ES114 strain*

8. Which strains show restored colonization? can we check if Syp pathway is restored?
**dont forget control group for RscS deficient ES114**
~note which Mb11B1 genes restored colonization, call them 'Es114-rescue-MB11B1' genes for now
~~ is this done in the animal or on plates?

## Future durections and confirmations
9. delete 'Es114-rescue-MB11B1' genes in MB11B1 and confirm no colonization

10. Overexpress 'Es114-rescue-MB11B1' genes in Mb11B1 genes and measure growth rate
-what's a good measure of colonization on a plate, biofilm formation/wrinkling? or just growth in culture?- 

What does a successful rescue mean? 
    Is Syp reactivated, meaning the MB11B1 gene stood in for RscS? 
What does an unsuccessful rescue mean?
    Different pathway altogether is responsible for colonization in MB11B1.
