### What should I know? 
*If and else statements*

An **else** statement can be combined with an **if** statement. An **else** statement contains the block of vode that executes if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value. 
The **else** statement is an optional statement and there could be at most only one 'else' statement following **if.**

if <test expression>:
  <statement>
else:
  statement (s)
  
  
Block is the code that will run when the test expression is true. If it doesn't evaluate to true, the block doesn't execute.

def absolute (x):

if x<0:

  x = -x
  
return x
