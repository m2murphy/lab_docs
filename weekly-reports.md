# Weekly Report #1 
*Week of February 20th through 24th*
## goals
1. Optimize coniditions to introduce transposon to community of MB11B1  
  a. reference Brooks 2016
  b. condition variables: temperature, medium, concentration/proportions  
  c. Tn5 transposase? or sample alternative transposon  
  d. How to measure uptake? Growth rate? tagging (gfp?)(antibiotic resistance?)  
  e. talk to mark haha
2. Format lab notebook style directory on GitHub 


## things completed  
1. Conjugation of MB11B1 and MJM1130 for library and collect colonies
2. Mating spots plated on selective media  
3. Motility comparision of MB11B1 and ES114 started  
4. Github (almost) mastered!  
5. Sexual misconduct training completed

## plans for next week  
1. Gather data for motility assay
2. Next steps for library  
> Grow mating plates for controls: Only donor and only recipient   
> Use more than one amount of Erm and see what's best for MB11B1
